Using Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike sharing company.

# Overview of Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a data-triven proposal to potential investors to support a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, we were able to create visualizations to see average biking durations trends and the relationships between gender and popular biking times. Specifically, this set of visualizations:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results

Visualizations of the data with analysis are shown below:

# Summary

From our analysis of the data, the peak times of use around the morning and evening commute lead us to infer that many users are not tourists, but rather work commuters. Any potential future marketing endeavours need to also take into account that the majority of riders are male. Most rides had an average time of 5 minutes with ride frequency dropping significantly for rides beyond 20 minutes. For a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, the data leads to a conclusion that having enough stations to avoid having them beyond the 20 minute biking distance from one another would lead to more rides. All of these inferences and recommendations need to be taken into account that the data this analysis was based on was from biking data in New York City, which is much more urbanized than Des Moines.
